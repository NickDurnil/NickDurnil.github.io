            <p>The goal of the pump curve analyzer is to take in an image of a graph and be able to create the best approximation we can.
                If a pump was not an internal pump, we would receive no data points and would have eyeball a handful of points to add into an excel sheet
                that would draw linear lines between each point. This would create a curve that underestimated curves and didn't create a very accurate
                representation of the line. My application had the user to click the image a handful of times and the program would create a best estimate 
                of the graph. The program saved 10-15 minutes per pump curve and allowed for greater accuracy compared to our previous version.

            <p> Using a P1AM ProOpen and some expansion modules, I created a program we could plug into any main pump and jockey pump combination and fake out
                the controllers to think they are operating normally. This would allow us to test the FireConnect website and ensure that the right data was being
                outputted. The program allowed us to use an HMI to set up the device and deploy it with different combinations of fire controllers and jockey controllers.

            <p> On the FireConnect boxes, there is a device called a TruMeter. This is used to rescale the output of a pressure sensor for diesel tanks. In order to 
                program the device, it is required to input 40 points by hand and change a handful of other settings. My program allows the user to input the tank 
                dimensions and it would automatically output the file a customer would need to upload to their TruMeter. The program allowed us to save about 10 min 
                per device and allowed for easier accessibility to creating these programs.
