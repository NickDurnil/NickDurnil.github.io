            <p>The goal of the pump curve analyzer is to take in an image of a graph and be able to create the best approximation we can.
                If a pump was not an internal pump, we would receive no data points and would have eyeball a handful of points to add into an excel sheet
                that would draw linear lines between each point. This would create a curve that underestimated curves and didn't create a very accurate
                representation of the line. My application had the user to click the image a few time and give the first and last point to create an
                line of best fit of the graph using a 6th order polynomial. A user would input the first point and the last point which allowed the program
                to convert the pixel spacing and convert it into the respective x and y units. The user would also input the units of the axis and would
                select the output units because in the FireConnect website we would have to submit imperial or metric curves depending on the client. The program
                saved 10-15 minutes per pump curve and allowed for greater accuracy.

            <p> Using a P1AM ProOpen and some expansion modules, I created a program we could plug into any main pump and jockey pump combination and fake out
                the controllers to think they are operating normally. This would allow us to test the FireConnect website and ensure that the right data was being
                outputted. The microcontroller in the P1AM ProOpen is an Arduino MRK Zero which allowed me to use the Arduino IDE to program it. In the program I used
                and interrupt timer so every point was outputted consistently every .1 seconds. The program used two expansion cards for analog current and voltage
                outputs which would allow a user to recreate the same signal a pressure transducer would be sending the fire pump controllers.

            </div>
            <p> 
                The P1AM connected to an HMI using MODBUS TCP/IP, allowing a user to input the sensor specifications. An example of this is some controllers use a .5-6V input where others
                use a 1-5V or 4-20mA. Because of this, the user would input this into the HMI and it would recalculate the outputs to properly fake the sensor. Because
                this test is used for long durations of time I had to save variables into flash storage in case the power would go out, the box could turn back on and
                resume the long term test. On top of this long test, there was a button that would turn on a pump flow test. This test would make the fire pump controller
                think there is a fire and start to run. This would cause the FireConnect unit to collect data at a faster rate and display it as a run even on the website.
                The previous program they were using was on an Automation Direct PLC and they had multiple different versions of the code they would reflash into the PLC
                to test the new combination of fire pump controller and jockey controller. The new program allows for a single program to be used for all combinations.

            <p> On the FireConnect boxes, there is a device called a TruMeter that takes a current input and rescales it to a full 4-20mA output. This is used to rescale
                the output of a pressure sensor for diesel tanks. Diesel tanks are cylindrical and put on their side so we could not estimate the volume when the sensor reads
                the max pressure because it would be undefined. Therefore we used the TruMeters to take an output that would be 4-13mA and rescale it to 4-20mA.
                There is a program that is used to write this to the controller but we would have to input all 40 data points into the program by hand before we sent
                to the customer. With the program I wrote, it allowed for a user to input 3 dimensions and the volume of the tank and create a program that could
                be sent straight to the customer within a few seconds. The previous way was an excel spreadsheet that didn't account for the sensor not being put in the
                proper location whereas my program accounts for that "C" dimension. This enabled the team to be able to have any user write the program regardless of their
                technical level and would save 10-15 minutes per diesel tank.
