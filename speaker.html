            <p> This was my first project out of high school and I was looking to simply make something I could bring to friends houses and listen to music.
                Originally the speaker was powered by a 12v lead acid battery that powered an amplifier that would drive the 2 front speakers up to 100 watts each.
                The original amplifier had a bluetooth receiver on it but since it is inside a metal box it doesn't work well so I added a bluetooth receiver
                and replaced the antenna with a bulkhead connection so I could add the antenna on the outside of the box and increase the range. After doing this,
                I found a hissing noise that was coming out of the speakers whenever I increased the volume. After some research I realized that I needed to isolate
                the bluetooth receiver and the amplifier so I added a dc to dc converter with ground isolation. The amplifier could work off of 12v or 24v so I later
                replaced it with a battery pack made of lithium ion batteries. I sourced the batteries, bms and spot welded and soldered everything together creating
                a 24v pack that was 6.8Ah.
