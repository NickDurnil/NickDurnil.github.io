            <p> <a href="https://www.foxvalleykart.com/">Fox Valley</a> is a local go-kart company in Lafayette that sells go-kart parts and blueprints
                Yamaha kt100 engines. In the 80s a senior made a go-kart engine dynamometer so that John Copeland(The owner of Fox Valley) could test engines.
                The engine dynamometer measures the torque and RPM of the engines so he can see how engines perform against each other in a semi ideal setting. This 
                was a server rack full of parts connected into a room with an elevator motor that the engine would be connected to to read the data.
                This plots an excel sheet showing the temperatures of the engine, the exhaust gas temperature, RPM, torque, and horsepower of the engine. 
                The original program ran using MS-DOS and a server rack of parts to allow the computer to read the data. I took the MS-DOS program to learn
                about how the back end worked and spent about 6 months taking apart the system and creating my own solution. On top of having to run the program,
                the only other requirement was that it could connect to modern printers which was an issue with the old design. I ended up coding the entire 
                program in python to run on a raspberry pi. The program allowed him to enter the same items he would normally and would automatically do 
                corrections for the environment. In the original program, John was able to put in a series of different data points including, temperature,
                wet bulb, dry bulb, and barometric pressure and the program would calculate a j607 and j1349 correction factors to correct for temperature, 
                humidity, and elevation so no matter what time of year he ran the engine, all of them should have corrected data. This would give data as if 
                the engines were tested at sea level in either 77&deg;F or 60&deg;F in 0% humidity. I attached a sensor to the raspberry pi that would allow 
                John to hit a button and automatically create the data points. At the end of the project we had condensed a full server rack of parts to 2 project 
                boxes, one with the raspberry pi and ADC chips to convert, and one for the original power devices to run the elevator motor.
